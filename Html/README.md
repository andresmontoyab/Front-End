# Html

Hypertext Markup language is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.

## First Steps

In order to start with html documents, the only thing that we need to do is to create a file with the extension html.

### What is a Tag?

Tag is one of the most important concepts of html and basically means all of those pre-defined syntax, that we can use in html.

In order to write Tag we must use the next structure.

```html
<tag-name>content</tag-name>
<p> Paragraph </p>
<h1> Title </h1>
```

### Basic Structure

In the next code we are going to see the basic structure for a html file.

- `<!DOCTYPE html>` :This line defines that we are going to use HTML5 version.

- `<head>` : In the head taf is going to be all the general information of the document

- `<meta charset="UTF-8>` : Define which encoding type uses, UTF-8 is an world wide standard.

- `<body>` : In the body tag is going to be all the content of the document like texts.

````html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Example test</h1>
    </body>
</html>
````
