I remember the first presentation that I presented to my team in globant was kinda funny and also embarasing. For this  


Months ago when i was presenting the first demo meeting in globant I made a huge error that was kinda funny and also embarrassing, while I was explaining everything about 
the presentation I shared my screen with the purpose of showing the new features of the application however I didn't notice that I shared the wrong screen until I figured out that my team had been laughing about something
finally I discovered that instead of showing the application I was showing a weird image that a co-worker just sent me.
